Digital KYC

The bank's digital KYC (Know Your Customer) process, while innovative, has been plagued by high rejection rates and customer abandonments, leading to suboptimal conversion rates and increased operational costs. Key issues include user errors during document selection and scanning, network-related upload failures, server-side validation delays, and mismatches in identity verification. This report evaluates a comprehensive solution that integrates client-side enhancements (such as on-device AI for auto-detection and quality checks) with server-side optimisations (like improved OCR, asynchronous processing, and human-in-loop reviews) to address these pain points.

The proposed solution directly targets all identified failure stages, aiming to reduce overall rejections by 50-70%. It emphasises fewer abandonments through intuitive UX, faster turnaround times (TAT) via automation and pre-checks, clearer next-step visibility with structured error messaging, and fewer re-submissions by providing guided retries and escalations. Expected outcomes include failure rate reductions across stages: from 15% to 3-5% in document selection, 35% to 10-15% in scanning, and similar improvements elsewhere.
While the solution is robust, residual risks such as device compatibility and network variability must be mitigated through fallbacks and monitoring. This report outlines detailed mappings, metrics, implementation steps, and monitoring strategies to ensure measurable success. Implementation should begin with an MVP focused on auto-detection and client pre-checks, followed by A/B testing and dashboard instrumentation.

By adopting this approach, the bank can achieve a more seamless, user-friendly KYC experience, aligning with regulatory requirements (e.g., mandatory PAN and Aadhaar for digital accounts) and boosting customer satisfaction and retention.
